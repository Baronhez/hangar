= Appendix - Container Registry
== What is a Container Registry?
* Docker registry is a service that is storing our docker images.
* Docker registry could be hosted by a third party, as public or private registry.
* Could be used one of the below:
  1. Docker Hub (https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/[link])
  2. Amazon Elastic Container Registry (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/docker-push-ecr-image.html[ECR])
  3. Google Container Registry (https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling[GCR])
  4. Azure Container Registry (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-get-started-docker-cli?tabs=azure-cli[ACR])
  5. IBM Cloud Container Registry (https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-registry[link])
  6. Oracle Container Registry (https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Registry/Tasks/registrypushingimagesusingthedockercli.htm[link])
  7. Alibaba Cloud Container Registry (https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/198212.htm[link])
  8. GitLab Container Registry (https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/[link])
  9. JFrog Container Registry (https://jfrog.com/container-registry/[link])
  10. Red Hat Quay  (https://quay.io/[link])
  11. Harbor  (https://goharbor.io/docs/2.3.0/install-config/[link])
  12. Portus  (http://port.us.org/docs/first-steps.html[link])
* We can host the Docker Registry by ourself using "docker registry" or other options like Quay, Harbor, Portus, etc.

== What is a Container Repository?
* Docker repository is a collection of different docker images with same name, that have different tags. 
* Tag is alphanumeric identifier of the image within a repository.
* For example see https://hub.docker.com/r/library/python/tags/[DockerTagExample]. 
  - There are many different tags for the official python image, these tags are all members of the official python repository on the Docker Hub. 
  - Docker Hub is a Docker Registry hosted by Docker.
  
== What is Docker Registry and why to use it?
* The Registry is a stateless, highly scalable server side application that stores and lets you distribute Docker images. 
* The Registry is open-source, under the permissive Apache license.
* You should use the Registry if you want to:
  - tightly control where your images are being stored
  - fully own your images distribution pipeline
  - integrate image storage and distribution tightly into your in-house development workflow
* Users looking for a zero maintenance, ready-to-go solution are encouraged to head-over to the Docker Hub.
* Docker Hub provides a free-to-use, hosted Registry, plus additional features (organization accounts, automated builds, and more).
* The Registry is compatible with Docker engine version 1.6.0 or higher.

== Azure Container Registry
* `az acr login --name mycontainerregistry`
* `docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/hello-world`
* `docker tag mcr.microsoft.com/hello-world mycontainerregistry.azurecr.io/hello-world:v1.1.2`
* `docker push mycontainerregistry.azurecr.io/hello-world:v1.1.2`

== Google Container Registry
* `docker pull gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0`
* `docker tag gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0 gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/quickstart-image:tag1`
* `docker push gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/quickstart-image:tag1`

== GitHub Container Registry
* `docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin`
* `docker pull ghcr.io/OWNER/IMAGE_NAME:1.14.1`
* `docker push ghcr.io/OWNER/IMAGE_NAME:latest`
